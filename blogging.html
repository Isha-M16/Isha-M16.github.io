          <p>This is Isha M, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer science in Dayananda Sagar University.I am from Hosur ,Tamil Nadu and did all of my schooling in Hosur.Some of the hobbies i love to do 
            in my free time include travelling, watching shows and movies, dancing, reading novels.Computer science is a vast subject and has a lot of subjects in it in which we can master.For me ,learning
            code and able to develop using that is a main attraction towars this subject.Coding being a very popular and important skill nowadays, also has a lot to offer us in terms of creativity, analysing
            , critical thinking,problem solving and also attention to detail.I must say that coding is an interesting part and i am glad i am able to learn it well.  </p>

          <h3><b>TRAVELLING</h3>
        </div>
    
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>Travelling to different places and exploring new things each time has always been my thing.I am a person who is much more into 
              visiting beautiful places rather than just going to fancy restaurants for eating.This enthusiasm has led me to a lot of places
              and more importantly i am grateful that i got the oppurtunity because of my aunt,uncle,sisters and my parents.The most amaing trip
              i ever had was for one month long,I know it's such a long period!I travelled a lot of places in north india at that time  and also am
              fond of adventures.The recent one i tried was the roller coaster ,The last trip to the amusement park made me try all kinds of rides.
              
              No to forget trekking ,one of the most amazing experience i had was in kedarnat with the freezing cold and was carried by horse,i also 
              kind of secretly hoped that i wont fall down or will lose my breath.Visiting beaches is a different level of excitement and fun especially
              for an enthusiast.

          <h4><b>DANCE</b></h4>
          <p>Just me, myself and I, grooving to the beats of any or every rhythm. I have been learning the bharatnatyam dance form since i was like 
              3 or 4 years old. Dance has always been my passion and i have been racticing it since years,i eel it is a great way to 
            forget all our worries and enjoy,Well dance surely does that.I have been trained in a lot of other fields too including 
            music,art,keyboard. Out of all,I have a large interest in dance and have trained in it a lot.</p>
